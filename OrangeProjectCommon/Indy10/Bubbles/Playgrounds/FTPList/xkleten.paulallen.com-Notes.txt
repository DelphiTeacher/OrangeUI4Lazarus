230-
230- Welcome!  You are logged in to a Tops-20 system, probably not familiar
230- to you.  We therefore offer this short note on directory and file naming
230- conventions:
230-
230- A file name consists of 2 required parts, and several optional parts, of
230- which 3 are important to you as an FTP user.  These 5 parts together are
230-
230- device:<directory>filename.filetype.generation
230-
230- where the punctuation is required.  The DEVICE:, <DIRECTORY>, and GENERATION
230- fields are optional, defaulting to current device and directory and latest
230- generation of the file.  File names are NOT in general case-sensitive.
230-
230- <DIRECTORY> may have subparts, separated by dots.  All the following are
230- syntactically valid directory specifications (though they may not exist on
230- this particular system):
230-
230- <FOO>  or  <FOO.BAR>  or  <FOO.BAR.QUUX>  or  <SRC.7.MONITOR.BUILD>
230-
230- GENERATION is numeric; it may take the special values 0 (latest generation),
230- -1 (new, next higher generation), -2 (oldest generation), and -3 (wildcard
230- for all generations), as well as specific numeric generations.
230-
230- DEVICE: usually represents the name of a file system.
230-
230- Wildcards are specified as * (match 0 or more characters) and % (match 1
230- single character).  To obtain all the command files in a directory, you
230- would ask for the retrieval of
230-
230- *.CMD.*
230-
230- To obtain the latest version of all the files with a 1-character FILETYPE,
230- you would request
230-
230- *.%.0
230-
230- Please contact the systems staff at this host if you have problems with
230- or questions about Tops-20 file names and FTP.
