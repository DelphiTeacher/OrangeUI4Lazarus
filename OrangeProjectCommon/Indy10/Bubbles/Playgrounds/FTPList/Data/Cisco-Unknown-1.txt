#Note that for the Cisco ISO router FTP Server, you specify a dir
#that clients can access with something such as "ftp-server topdir disk0:/syslogd.dir".
#Note that you have to restrict a user to a specif area.
#My guess is that this server is oriented towards reading only specific files such as syslog output.
