#Hi, I'm having a problem with the FTP service on Windows 2003. If it's 
#configured to return directory listings in Unix format, then there is no 
#problem. However, if it's configured to return listings in MS-DOS format 
#(the default) then there is a problem.
#
#It doesn't support MLSD/MLST. The output, for example, for doing a list 
#command is:
#
#02-05-05  01:44PM       <DIR>          test1
#
#Indy is taking this entire string as the filename.
#
#Any ideas?
#
#Thanks

#After investigating further, it appears this problem is only occurring 
#if the directory has only one sub-directory in it. There are no problems 
#if there is more than one file or sub-directory, or if there's just one 
#file in there.
