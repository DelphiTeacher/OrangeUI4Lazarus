Format of this file is as follows:

Each section begins with a line starting with a colon (:).

The first line after the colon is the test data to enter 
the BreakApart function and the second line is the break
string to enter the BreakApart function.  The third line
is the expected number of results.

Following these three lines are the results expected of the
BreakApart, one per entry expected in the resulting TStrings
list.

Comments may be placed between each test and after the colon
of the starting line.
