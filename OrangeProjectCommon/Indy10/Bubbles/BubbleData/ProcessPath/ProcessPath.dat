
The format of this data file is as follows:

Each data set begins with a line starting with a colon (:).
The three lines following this are the parameters to the
ProcessPath function: Base Path, Path and Delimiter.  The
fourth line is the expected result.

The five lines that make up a single test must be together.
Any lines preceding the first test (i.e., these ones) and
any lines after the fifth line of a test and the start of the
next test can be utilised for comments and will be ignored.
Additionally, text after the colon will also be ignored.

: A wacky start. ;-)
